# Counter App

## Description

The **Counter App** is a simple and interactive app that allows users to manage a counter value. Users can increment, decrement, and reset the counter, with visual feedback through snack bar messages. The app is built using **Flutter** and leverages the **Bloc** pattern for efficient state management.

## Features

- **Increment Counter**: Click the plus icon to increase the counter value by 1.
- **Decrement Counter**: Click the minus icon to decrease the counter value by 1.
- **Reset Counter**: Press the reset button to reset the counter value to 0.
- **Snack Bar Feedback**: Snack bars notify the user of every increment, decrement, and reset action.
- **State Management with Bloc**: Utilizes the Bloc library for clear separation of UI and business logic.
